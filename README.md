#realtimeconfeu - Lyon, France - a WebRTC demo

This repo contains the source code (html,css,js) for a "simple 1-many video/audio call & conference". The simple chat uses WebRTC DataChannels.

It uses only the JavaScript API of XSockets.NET and a PeerConnection Broker hosted on Azure.  More info on http://xsockets.net
